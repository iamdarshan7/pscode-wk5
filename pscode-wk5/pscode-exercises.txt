// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(Your pseudocode here)
1. ask user for inputing two number. let's say a and b are two variables.
2. add a and b
3. store the value obtained from step 2 at sum variable.
4. print the sum variable.

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)
1. Ask user for inputing a number. let's say a as the input varible.
2. calcuate a % 2 == 0
3. if the result of the step 2 is True, Print the input number was even number.
4. Else print the input number was odd number.

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)
1. Initialize sum to 0
2. Initialize min and max to the first number read
3. Repeat the following 4 times:
   a. Read a number from the user
   b. Add the number to the sum
   c. If the number is smaller than min, update min
   d. If the number is larger than max, update max
4. Calculate average as sum divided by 5
5. Print "The average of the 5 numbers is: " average number
6. Print "The smallest number is: " min number
7. Print "The largest number is: " max number
